# ITS — Tech Debt

Items deliberately deferred. Each carries the rationale for deferral and the trigger for revisiting. The repo-side companion to Master Checklist §6 (planning project) — this file holds execution-layer tech debt; the Master Checklist holds owner-decision tech debt.

When to add an entry: a session deliberately chooses preservation-over-refactor (per Op Stds v9 §14), discovers an external-API constraint that forced a workaround, or defers a non-trivial cleanup that's larger than the current session can absorb. When to mark CLOSED: the underlying item is resolved in a commit; preserve the entry with resolution detail rather than deleting (history is cheap, context is expensive).

## parse_job_v3.py:656 — `existing_keys` dead code [CLOSED 2026-05-17]

Resolved in commit **`1fd6751`**. The unfinished de-dup attempt was removed and F841 came off the `box_migration/*` per-file-ignores. Originating commit (which suppressed it) was `8dfc6e8`; ground was tracked in `docs/session_logs/2026-05-17_ruff_and_doc_refresh.md`.

The fix was a deliberate departure from Op Stds v7 §14 (preservation-over-refactor) because the F841 was real dead code rather than a stylistic false positive, and the cleanup was five lines with zero behavior change. The preservation rule remains in effect for the rest of `box_migration/*`.

## Smartsheet API constraint: DATETIME columns require system column type [OPEN]

Discovered 2026-05-17 evening while provisioning `ITS_Errors`, `ITS_Quarantine`, and other sheets. The Smartsheet "Create Sheet" endpoint accepts `DATETIME` columns only when paired with `systemColumnType: MODIFIED_DATE | CREATED_DATE`. User-defined DATETIME columns (e.g., "Timestamp", "Surfaced At", "Resolved At", "Received At", "Reviewed At") are rejected with a generic HTTP 500 / error code 4000 and no descriptive message.

**Workaround:** Use `DATE` for all user-defined date columns. Time-of-day precision is lost from the in-sheet representation.

**Mitigation:** Smartsheet's intrinsic row-level `created_at` (and `modified_at`) attributes are full datetimes and are queryable via the API. Code-side ordering and time-of-day inspection use those fields rather than the in-sheet DATE columns. The in-sheet DATE columns serve human readability; the intrinsic timestamps serve programmatic precision.

**Revisit when:** Smartsheet API surfaces user-editable DATETIME columns, or a workstream finds DATE-only resolution genuinely insufficient and the `created_at` fallback isn't viable for the use case.

## Smartsheet API constraint: AUTO_NUMBER columns rejected at sheet creation [OPEN]

Discovered same session. `systemColumnType: AUTO_NUMBER` is rejected at the "Create Sheet" endpoint, whether or not the column is primary, with or without an `autoNumberFormat` config. Other system column types (`MODIFIED_DATE`, `MODIFIED_BY`) are accepted in the same payload — so the rejection is specific to AUTO_NUMBER, not a generic system-column-at-create issue.

**Workaround:** Each system sheet's primary column is a plain `TEXT_NUMBER` that code populates with a descriptive label ("Error", "Quarantined Message", "Entry"). Smartsheet's intrinsic row IDs serve as the unique identity for any code-side references.

**Mitigation:** Code-side row references use the Smartsheet row ID (returned in every API response). The human-readable primary column gives operators a meaningful label in the UI without needing auto-numbering.

**Revisit when:** A workstream requires user-visible auto-IDs (e.g., a customer-facing ticket number) and the code-populated label pattern is insufficient. Likely never — the intrinsic row IDs cover the technical need and labels cover the human need.

## parse_job_v3: V/S vendor-sub enumeration unclaimed [CLOSED 2026-05-19]

Resolved by adding `parse_vendor_sub(raw) -> Optional[VendorSubParse]` to `box_migration/parse_job_v3.py` and inserting it into the reconcile harness's claim chain between `subsubject` and `canonical_non_job`. Regex shape `^(?P<letter>[VS])(?P<index>\d{2})\.\s+(?P<name>.+?)\s*$` — capped at two digits so single-digit V1./S1. stay in `SUBJOB_LETTER_UC`'s domain.

Coverage delta when re-running the reconcile against the live 10-portfolio listings: **212 unique names** moved from unclaimed to `vendor_sub` (the original tech_debt estimate of 60–90 was an under-count; estimate was based on unique-occurrence math but the actual unique-name count is higher). Unclaimed share dropped 54.9% → 51.1%. Full 33-test coverage in `tests/test_parse_vendor_sub.py`.

Resolution: see commit on the `feature/vendor-sub-parser` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-19_chore_sweep_and_mypy_lockdown.md`.

## parse_job_v3: ISO date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD) unclaimed [CLOSED 2026-05-19]

Resolved by extending `parse_date_prefix` in-place with a new `DATE_PREFIX_ISO` regex (`^(?P<date>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})\s+(?P<topic>.+?)\s*$`). ISO matches return `DatePrefixParse` with `direction='ISO'`, joining the existing `R` / `S` discriminators in the same `direction` field. R./S. behavior is preserved unchanged; covered by regression tests in `tests/test_parse_date_prefix.py`.

Reconcile claim chain extended with a new `date_prefix` claim between `vendor_sub` and `canonical_non_job` — needed because the existing chain had no date-prefix claim at all, so ISO matches wouldn't have shown up in reconcile output otherwise. Side effect: existing uppercase R./S. and chaos-flagged lowercase r./s. forms now also get claimed structurally (chaos detection is orthogonal — same name can be both `date_prefix` claimed AND `date_prefix_lowercase` chaos-flagged).

Coverage delta when re-running the reconcile: **11 unique names** in the new `date_prefix` claim (mix of ISO + R./S. + lowercase r./s. forms; tech_debt entry estimated ~13 ISO uniques, close enough). Unclaimed share dropped 51.1% → 50.9%.

24 tests cover the new ISO form, R./S. regression, lowercase r./s. warning preservation, direction discriminator, and negatives. Tests at `tests/test_parse_date_prefix.py`.

Resolution: see commit on the `feature/iso-date-prefix` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-19_chore_sweep_and_mypy_lockdown.md`.

## parse_job_v3: person_tag_in_subject chaos over-match [CLOSED 2026-05-20]

Resolved by adopting **Direction (A)** from `docs/person_tag_audit_2026-05-19.md`: the third alternation (`-\s*[A-Z][a-z]+\s*$`, "trailing-capitalized-word after dash") was removed from `PERSON_TAG_IN_SUBJECT` in `box_migration/parse_job_v3.py`. The refined regex keeps the two alternations that the audit confirmed as high-precision:

```python
PERSON_TAG_IN_SUBJECT = re.compile(
    r'(\bfor\s+[A-Z]{3,}\b|'                            # "for ZACK"
    r'^[A-Z][a-z]+\s+(Organize|Cleanup|Notes|Files)\b)'  # "Teala Organize folder"
)
```

Consumer path (`detect_chaos` in the same file) is unchanged — the chaos flag still surfaces for alt-1 / alt-2 matches; alt-3 over-matches no longer fire. `m.group(0)` is the only match-object accessor downstream, so removing one alternation has no group-index ripple.

**Coverage delta (projection from the 2026-05-19 audit; live listings under `~/Downloads/Box_listings_for_Seth/` not present locally to re-measure):** ~138 person_tag chaos hits → ~2–4 hits across the 10-portfolio corpus. The 2–4 retained hits are alt-1 / alt-2 forms only (explicit "for XXX" and "First Organize/Cleanup/Notes/Files"); the ~95% noise from alt 3 is gone. A few real-or-leaning-real person-tag cases from the audit (samples #15–#20: `Structural - Bowman`, `R. Bowman-Pungo`, etc.) lose their flag by design — operator triages those visually in the folder tree. The audit doc has the full FP-vs-TP tradeoff analysis.

27 tests cover the refinement in `tests/test_person_tag.py`:
- Group A (7 tests): alt 1 + alt 2 positive-regression coverage across the audit's TPs.
- Group B (13 tests): every confirmed FP from the audit (rows #1–#12 + sample #19) — negative locks so reintroducing alt 3 fails the suite.
- Group C (5 tests): `KNOWN_TP_LOSSES_NO_LONGER_FLAGGED` acceptance lock — audit samples #15, #16, #17, #18, #20. The list and its comment block point a future maintainer back to the audit doc before they "re-add the missing coverage."
- Consumer-path integration (2 tests): `detect_chaos()` surfaces the flag for a TP and skips it for the most-common audit FP (`-Tracking` suffix).

**Redo history:** an earlier attempt (PR #34) implemented this same change but was closed-without-merge during a 2026-05-20 branch-cleanup pass where the head branch was deleted before verifying the merge had actually landed. The chore PR #37 explicitly preserved this entry's `[OPEN]` status; the present resolution comes from the redo PR. The cleanup-pass mistake is captured as a private feedback memory (`feedback_verify_merge_before_branch_delete`): always `gh pr view <N> --json mergedAt` before `git push origin --delete`, do not infer merge from "I saw CI green."

Resolution: see commit on the `feature/person-tag-regex-refinement-redo` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-20_person_tag_regex_refinement_redo.md`. Audit context preserved at `docs/person_tag_audit_2026-05-19.md` (not modified by this PR).

## smartsheet_migration: import-time side effects in three scripts [CLOSED 2026-05-19]

Resolved by wrapping each script's top-level API work in a `main()` function behind `if __name__ == "__main__":`. Module-level constants (`SOURCE`, `DEST`, `SRC_TO_DEST_TITLE`) stay at module scope (cheap and pure). Imports refactored from `import os, sys` to PEP 8 form. No behavior change when invoked from the shell.

`tests/test_migration_import_hygiene.py` (new) locks the regression in: parametrized test imports each of the three modules with `SMARTSHEET_TOKEN` un-set; all 3 pass. If a future edit accidentally puts API-calling code back at module scope, the test will catch it.

The per-file-ignores `["E401", "I001", "F401", "B007", "UP035"]` in `pyproject.toml` for `smartsheet_migration/*` were NOT removed — 3 other files in the directory (`build_human_review.py`, `classify_closeout.py`, `migrate_schedule.py`) still use `import os, sys` and need the E401 ignore. Documented this in the session log so the ignores aren't mistaken for unnecessary on a future audit.

Resolution: see commit on the `fix/smartsheet-migration-import-time` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-19_chore_sweep_and_mypy_lockdown.md`.

## mypy: import-untyped noise from vendor SDKs without stubs [CLOSED 2026-05-19]

Resolved by adding the proper stub package for `requests` (`types-requests` added to dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`) and a `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` block silencing missing-stub errors for `msal` and `smartsheet` (neither publishes type information upstream as of 2026-05).

After applying, `mypy .` reports **zero errors** across all 64 source files. Brought the baseline from 4 → 0.

Locked in by adding mypy as a **blocking CI step** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — silent type drift across PRs is no longer possible. Mypy now runs in parallel with ruff and pytest; failure of any step blocks merge.

Resolution: see commit on the `feature/mypy-zero-and-ci` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-19_chore_sweep_and_mypy_lockdown.md`.

## parse_job_v3.py: matched needs type annotation [CLOSED 2026-05-18]

Resolved by adding the explicit annotation `matched: dict[Schema, list[str]] = {...}` in `classify_schema()`. Inferred type from `_V3_SIGNATURES` keys (Schema enum members) and the `.append(name)` call site where `name` is a `str`. One-line annotation change; zero behavior change. Preservation-over-refactor §14 honored — only the annotation line was modified.

Resolution: see commit on the `fix/parse-job-v3-matched-annotation` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-18_alert_critical_and_mypy_closure.md`.

Originally surfaced 2026-05-18 in the mypy baseline reconciliation; see `docs/reports/2026-05-18_mypy_baseline.md` for the lifecycle context.

## smartsheet_migration/ss_api.py: api body arg type mismatch [CLOSED 2026-05-18]

Resolved by widening the `body` parameter annotation on `api()` from `dict | None` to `dict | list | None`. Single-character-class edit on the signature line; all existing call sites continue to type-check (the `add_rows()` caller that passed `list[dict]` now matches). Real-bug carve-out under Op Stds v8 §14.

Resolution: see commit on the `fix/ss-api-body-arg-type` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-18_alert_critical_and_mypy_closure.md`.

Originally surfaced 2026-05-18 in the mypy baseline reconciliation; see `docs/reports/2026-05-18_mypy_baseline.md` for the lifecycle context.

## smartsheet_migration/migrate_fl.py: warnings list type annotation [CLOSED 2026-05-18]

Resolved by adding the explicit annotation `warnings: list[str] = []` in `derive_payment_method()`. Element type inferred from the `.append(...)` call sites which pass string literals describing payment-method derivation warnings. One-line annotation change; zero behavior change.

Resolution: see commit on the `fix/migrate-fl-warnings-annotation` branch (squash-merged), and `docs/session_logs/2026-05-18_alert_critical_and_mypy_closure.md`.

## Mail.app rule silent disable on macOS updates [OPEN]

macOS updates have a known pattern of silently disabling Mail.app rules without warning. Affects any workstream whose intake depends on Mail.app rules routing messages to the Claude Code script.

Workaround / mitigation: Watchdog (Op Stds v9 §2) must include an inbound-mail-processed-in-24h check. If watchdog observes no recent intake activity from a given workstream, surface as WARN to operator. Originally captured in Foundation Scaffold v4 "Outstanding Gotchas"; carried forward through v5; re-surfaced via Cascade Audit Errata 2026-05-19.

Resolves when: shared/watchdog.py implements inbound-mail-activity check across all intake-bearing workstreams (Excellence Roadmap v2.1 Track 1 R2).

## PowerShell macOS Gatekeeper deprecation 2026-09-01 [OPEN]

The powershell@preview cask path used for EXO ServicePrincipal management (Connect-ExchangeOnline; New-ServicePrincipal) is scheduled for macOS Gatekeeper deprecation on 2026-09-01. Without intervention, post-deprecation runs will fail Gatekeeper signature verification on the cutover MacBook.

Plan B: Azure Cloud Shell. Same Connect-ExchangeOnline + New-ServicePrincipal commands run in a browser shell instead of local PowerShell. No code change required; runbook change only.

Cutover impact: Handover Plan v6 Step 4 verification currently assumes local PowerShell. If Phase 1.5 cutover lands after 2026-09-01, runbook needs the Azure Cloud Shell variant.

Resolves when: 2026-08-15 calendar check confirms status (still scheduled / postponed / cask alternative emerged). Runbook updated based on findings.

## anomaly_logger: SUSPICIOUS_FIELD_PATTERNS will false-positive on legitimate system_* fields [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`shared/anomaly_logger.py` flags any extraction field name matching `^system_` as a security anomaly (Phase 1 starter sentinel list for prompt-injection detection). The pattern is correct against the threat model — a legitimate workstream extraction schema shouldn't include `system_*` field names, so their presence suggests the AI invented them under injection.

**The risk:** this is a forward-dated FP source. As workstream extraction schemas mature, any legitimate field with a `system_` prefix (e.g., `system_version`, `system_id`, `system_serial_number` on machine pre-inspections) will fire `security_flag=True` on every extraction, polluting `ITS_Review_Queue` with noise and training operators to dismiss the flag.

Tuning belongs to the first 30 days of sandbox operation against real extraction outputs (per Safety Reports Brief v6 — "Phase 1 sentinel list, extend as patterns emerge"). The sentinel list should be re-audited once `safety_reports/weekly_generate.py` has run against the migrated closed-project corpus and produced a representative extraction sample.

**Specific suggested follow-ups when tuning lands:**
- Narrow `^system_` to specific known-bad names (`system_prompt`, `system_role`, `system_instruction`) rather than the prefix glob.
- Same audit for `^role_` and `^ignore_` — both have similar FP-on-legitimate-naming risk.
- Add a `tests/test_anomaly_logger.py` case for any legitimate field name that ends up in a real extraction schema, so the sentinel list and the schemas can't drift apart.

Surfaced 2026-05-20 in a senior-dev audit pass; not yet triggered in practice because no workstream extraction has shipped.

## R2 Watchdog Check E (Anthropic spend trend) deferred to Phase 1.5 [OPEN 2026-05-20]

Check E of R2 Watchdog (Anthropic API spend trend analysis) deferred to a follow-on PR (the Check E shipping PR) at Phase 1.5 production cutover. **Architectural choice, not capability gap.** Individual Anthropic orgs DO expose Admin keys once a formal Organization is created (Settings → Organization with business address; verified 2026-05-20). Deferral rationale: sandbox spend signal-to-noise is too low at $5-credit scale for trend analysis to produce meaningful alerts. Re-evaluate at production cutover when spend is real and recurring. Implementation will add `shared/anthropic_billing.py` + `_check_spend_trend` in `scripts/watchdog.py`, seed the 4 `spend.*` `ITS_Config` rows + the `system.anthropic_admin_api_keychain_key` row, and convert the existing smoke runner's Phase E from a SKIPPED placeholder into a real exerciser.

Originally surfaced 2026-05-20 in R2 Session 2 pre-flight (the Keychain `ITS_ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY` held a workspace key, `sk-ant-api03-…` prefix, not an Admin key). Session 2 shipped Checks A/B/C/D/F via PR #36; Check E is the only outstanding piece of the R2 Watchdog spec.

## PowerShell `Get-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity <friendly-name>` directory lookup fails [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`Get-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity <friendly-name>` fails with a directory-object-not-found error in Exchange Online PowerShell, even when the policy exists and is valid.

**Workaround:** call the bare cmdlet (no `-Identity`) and filter the result set client-side. Pattern: `Get-ApplicationAccessPolicy | Where-Object { $_.Description -match '<keyword>' }` or pipe to `Select` and pattern-match the returned rows.

Captured 2026-05-20 during M365 sandbox re-verification while validating the `ITS Scoped Mailboxes` policy for R2 Watchdog Check F. The bare-cmdlet form returned a valid record with `IsValid: True` despite the friendly-name lookup failing seconds earlier on the same policy.

## voice@ mailbox AppAccessPolicy scope addition pending [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`voice@evergreenmirror.com` is one of 5 ITS-intake mailboxes (per the mailbox roster) but is NOT currently in the `ITS Scoped Mailboxes` ApplicationAccessPolicy scope. Confirmed by `Get-ApplicationAccessPolicy` on 2026-05-20 — current scope covers `safety / procurement / subcontracts / its`, no `voice@`.

**Resolves when:** an ITS workstream activates the `voice@` mailbox as an intake source. At that point: add `voice@evergreenmirror.com` to the AppAccessPolicy scope via Exchange Online PowerShell, and register the corresponding `mail_intake.voice.max_idle_hours` row in `ITS_Config` so R2 Watchdog Check F starts monitoring it. No code change required for the policy update; the watchdog already iterates `mail_intake.*` rows via `smartsheet_client.get_settings_with_prefix` (PR #36).

## Stale Anthropic Service Account `svac_…SR7vDMJ` for archival [OPEN 2026-05-20]

Stale Anthropic Service Account `svac_…SR7vDMJ` (created during R2 Watchdog Check E investigation 2026-05-20) flagged for archival. The associated workspace API key has already been deleted from macOS Keychain. No urgency; clean up when next in the Anthropic Console (Settings → Service Accounts → Archive). Captured here so the cleanup isn't forgotten at the next Anthropic-Console visit.

## Remove unused `[jwt]` extra from boxsdk dependency [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`pyproject.toml` currently pins `boxsdk[jwt]>=3.10.0,<4.0.0`. The `[jwt]` extra pulls in `PyJWT` and `cryptography` transitively. ITS uses OAuth 2.0 User Authentication (per PR #39, commit `2ce6ece`) and never exercises the JWT auth path; the extra dependencies are dead weight in the install tree.

**Action:** change to plain `boxsdk>=3.10.0,<4.0.0`. Run `scripts/smoke_test_box.py` after the change to confirm the OAuth path still works.

**Urgency:** low. No functional impact, just install-tree hygiene.

Surfaced: PR #39 review, 2026-05-20.

## Eventually migrate from legacy boxsdk to `box_sdk_gen` (Gen API) [OPEN 2026-05-20]

The `boxsdk` PyPI package jumped to a renamed Gen API at 10.x (imports as `box_sdk_gen`, with a substantially different surface). PR #39 pins to `<4.0.0` to use the legacy 3.x API. The Gen API is the future direction per Box; legacy 3.x will eventually be deprecated.

**Action:** re-evaluate when (a) Box announces a deprecation timeline for 3.x, (b) the legacy API lacks something the Gen API offers, or (c) annual dependency-hygiene sweep.

**Migration scope:** `shared/box_client.py`, `tests/test_box_client.py`, `scripts/setup_box_oauth.py`, `scripts/smoke_test_box.py`. Probably non-trivial (~half day of work).

**Urgency:** low. Pin holds until Box deprecation pressure or capability gap.

Surfaced: PR #39 review, 2026-05-20.

## Add Box refresh-token age check to R2 Watchdog [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`ITS_BOX_REFRESH_TOKEN` rotates on every Box API call and stays valid as long as ITS makes at least one Box call every 60 days. If ITS goes dark for >60 days (extended outage, post-handover period without activity), the refresh token expires and re-running `scripts/setup_box_oauth.py` is required.

A watchdog check would warn the operator before the token expires:
- **Warn** at 50 days since last rotation
- **Critical** at 58 days

**Mechanism:** track last-rotation timestamp via either
- (a) a sidecar Keychain entry `ITS_BOX_REFRESH_TOKEN_LAST_ROTATED` updated by the `store_tokens` callback in `shared/box_client.py`, or
- (b) a row in `ITS_Config` (`system.box_refresh_token_last_rotated`).

**Implementation venue:** R2 Watchdog Session 2 (planning pass needed first) or later. Not blocking; absence of this check is documented in the handover runbook as a known operator-touch requirement.

**Urgency:** medium. Real risk if ITS goes dark for an extended period post-handover. Pre-handover is fine because ITS runs daily.

Surfaced: PR #39 brief, 2026-05-20.

## Phase 1.5 — provision dedicated ITS Box user account, re-auth [OPEN 2026-05-20]

ITS currently authenticates to Box as `seths@evergreenmirror.com` (operator account). All API actions attribute to that user in Box audit trails, and all ITS-created files are owned by that user.

At Phase 1.5 cutover, provision a dedicated ITS Box user account (e.g., `its@evergreenrenewables.com` once the production tenant is live) and re-authenticate ITS as that user. No code changes needed — just re-run `scripts/setup_box_oauth.py` while logged into Box as the new user.

**Concerns to handle at migration time:**
- File ownership of anything ITS created under the operator account may need to be transferred to the new user.
- Collaborator permissions on existing folders must be granted to the new user before re-auth.
- Old refresh token under the operator account should be revoked in the Box account settings.

**Urgency:** Phase 1.5 cutover task. Not before.

Surfaced: PR #39 brief, 2026-05-20.

## Confirm `canonical_job_path()` format with owner [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`shared/box_client.py` exposes `canonical_job_path(customer, job_number, job_name, year)` which returns `"/Customer/JobNum — JobName/YYYY/"`. This is the WRITE-path format for new ITS-created content.

Owner confirmation has not happened yet — the format is the legacy-stub placeholder, never validated against owner preference. `box_migration/parse_job_v3.py` handles read-side recognition of the 4 active Box schemas, so this only affects what ITS creates going forward, not what it can recognize.

**Action:** surface to owner at next opportunity, confirm or adjust format, update `shared/box_client.py` + tests if needed.

**Urgency:** low until the first workstream consumes `canonical_job_path`. At that point the decision becomes blocking and locks the format for all future ITS-created content.

Surfaced: PR #39 brief, Open Question Q2, 2026-05-20.

## Seed `system.box_smoke_folder_id` in ITS_Config [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`scripts/smoke_test_box.py` supports a `--write-test` opt-in flag that does a write-read-delete loop against a known sandbox folder. The folder ID comes from an `ITS_Config` row at `system.box_smoke_folder_id`.

The row is not yet seeded. The read-only smoke (default invocation) works without it; only the opt-in write-test path requires it.

**Action:** create a dedicated "ITS Smoke" folder in Box, copy its folder ID, seed the `ITS_Config` row. After seeding, run `python3 scripts/smoke_test_box.py --write-test` once to confirm.

**Urgency:** low. Read-only smoke is sufficient for most operator checks. Write-test is useful only when diagnosing suspected scope or permission issues.

## Alert-routing dedupe key granularity [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`shared/alert_dedupe.py` keys dedupe windows on `(script, error_code)` (built at the `_fire_resend_leg` call site). Today's only call path uses `error_code="uncaught_exception"`, so all decorator-driven CRITICALs from a given script collapse into one window. If production shows distinct underlying exception classes inside one script collapsing within a window — and the operator misses the second bug because the first one suppressed its alert — upgrade the key to `(script, error_code, exc_class)`.

**Action:** one-line change at the `dedupe_key = f"{script}::{error_code}"` site in `shared/error_log._fire_resend_leg`. Thread `exc_class` from the decorator's `except Exception as e:` path via `type(e).__name__`.

**Urgency:** low until production surfaces the collapse-different-bugs failure mode. Bounded blast radius — Smartsheet ITS_Errors + Sentry still record each bug separately, so the operator sees the second bug eventually; only the wake-up email is delayed.

Surfaced: PR α (alert-dedupe-core) brief, 2026-05-20.

## Cross-leg dedupe activation [OPEN 2026-05-20]

PR α suppresses only the Resend leg. Sentry events and Smartsheet ITS_Errors rows always write (per Op Stds v9 §27 — dedupe applies only to push, never to records). Today this is the right choice: Sentry's own alert rules and Smartsheet's sheet-level notifications are NOT configured.

**Resolves when:** the operator configures Sentry alert rules (or Smartsheet notifications) that themselves wake the operator on every event. At that point, those legs become "push" surfaces too and need their own dedupe layer. The shared `correlation_id` is already wired through all three legs, so a future cross-leg dedupe (or alert-aggregator) has the join key it needs.

**Urgency:** activates only when external alert rules are configured. No risk while Sentry/Smartsheet stay record-only.

Surfaced: PR α (alert-dedupe-core) brief, 2026-05-20.

## Alert-dedupe state is per-machine [OPEN 2026-05-20]

`~/its/state/alert_dedupe.json` lives on the local MacBook. The dedupe window is per-host. If ITS ever runs on multiple hosts (Phase 4+ blueprint generalization, or a hot-spare during MacBook RMA), each host would dedupe independently — and an operator-facing flapping CRITICAL on two hosts would produce one email per host instead of one total.

**Resolves when:** ITS gains multi-host execution. The state needs to move into a centralized store. Smartsheet itself can't host it (Smartsheet IS a triple-fire leg; circular dependency). Likely candidates: a dedicated S3 prefix, a Redis sidecar, or a per-customer SQLite that lives on whichever host happens to be authoritative.

**Urgency:** low. Phase 1 through Phase 3 is single-host on a designated MacBook. Multi-host is a Phase 4+ blueprint-generalization decision.

## Alert-dedupe state file grows unboundedly until PR β lands [OPEN 2026-05-20]

PR α writes one entry per `(script, error_code)` key to `~/its/state/alert_dedupe.json` and never deletes. The follow-up PR β (watchdog summary sweep) will delete entries once their summary email has fired and `summarized=true` has been set. Until PR β lands, the file grows.

**Bounded blast radius:** one entry per distinct `(script, error_code)` pair across the ITS lifetime. Even pessimistically (every shared module and every workstream each producing a handful of error codes), the file should stay under a few KB. Operationally acceptable but tracked here so a future operator reviewing the state file isn't surprised by the growth pattern.

**Resolves with:** PR β landing. Watchdog summary sweep iterates entries with `now >= window_ends_at AND summarized == false`, sends one summary email per entry (containing the `suppressed_count` and time range), sets `summarized=true`, then deletes once the entry is older than some retention threshold.

**Urgency:** none. PR β is queued for the next session.
