"""Suite-wide test fixtures.

Two of the autouse fixtures below are the long-standing pair, default-applied to every
test under `tests/`:

1. `_mock_keychain` — replaces `shared.keychain.get_secret` with a stub
   that returns deterministic test tokens (`f"test-{service}"`).
   Eliminates the macOS-only `security` CLI dependency (which was failing
   on Linux CI runners since PR #68's R3 Session 3 introduced
   `safety_reports/weekly_send_poll.py`).

   NOTE: this fixture was long described here as preventing "accidental live
   network calls". It does not, and never did — a placeholder token makes an
   outbound call FAIL (401), it does not stop the socket from opening. That
   misreading is why thousands of real 401s/day reached Smartsheet, Resend and
   Sentry and polluted the live operator log. `_forbid_external_network` below
   is the control that actually holds that line.

2. `_mock_kill_switch_state` — patches the `get_setting` attribute on
   `shared.kill_switch.smartsheet_client` so the `@require_active`
   decorator sees `system.state="ACTIVE"` by default. Tests that
   exercise kill-switch behavior re-mock inside the test body; the
   re-mock takes precedence because pytest applies test-local
   `mocker.patch` after autouse fixtures.

Integration tests gated by `-m integration` need real keychain access AND
real Smartsheet calls. `_mock_keychain` auto-opts-out of the stub for any
test carrying the `integration` marker (module-level `pytestmark` OR a
per-test `@pytest.mark.integration` decorator) — so a new integration test
gets the real keychain automatically, with no filename list to maintain.
The marker check resolves per-test, so MIXED files (one whose unit tests
must keep the stub but whose `@pytest.mark.integration` tests must not)
are handled correctly.

Why conftest.py rather than per-test mocks: the per-call-site mock
strategy is fragile when a downstream library (`shared.kill_switch`)
makes calls on its OWN namespace binding rather than the importing
test's binding. The conftest patches the *source* attribute, so any
import path that resolves to `shared.keychain.get_secret` /
`shared.kill_switch.smartsheet_client.get_setting` gets the stub.

The conftest fix is the immediate hole-closer. A durable structural fix
(lazy keychain loading + dependency-injected kill_switch) is logged in
`docs/tech_debt.md` as a follow-on.

# autouse fixture below is the DRIFT-PROOF catch: it wraps the two write idioms
# (`Path.write_text`/`write_bytes` for markers; `os.replace` for the sanctioned
# `state_io` atomic-write) and raises on any write resolving under a protected
# live dir — regardless of which module's per-daemon STATE_DIR / WATCHDOG_MARKER_DIR
# constant produced the path. Real paths captured ONCE here, before any test-local

# 2026-07-19 alone (80% of that day's WARN/ERROR/CRITICAL volume), and the same
# pollution was mis-diagnosed as a Smartsheet outage three separate times.
#
# Two compounding reasons that mattered: `error_log.LOG_DIR` is absolute
# (~/its/logs), so the noise lands in the OPERATOR's log no matter which checkout
# runs pytest; and a test-emitted CRITICAL genuinely attempts to PAGE the operator
# through Resend — stopped only by the placeholder key being rejected. A wrong

    files while the suite reported clean. Two compounding reasons it stayed hidden:
    the `.lock` creation precedes any `os.replace`, and the AssertionError raised by
    the `os.replace` hook was then SWALLOWED by `SustainedFailureCounter.record()`'s
    broad `except Exception` (which now re-raises AssertionError for exactly this
    reason). Hooking open() in write modes catches the class, not the one caller.
